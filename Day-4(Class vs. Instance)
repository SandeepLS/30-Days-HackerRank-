//Explain:Def
/*Objects have states and behaviors.
Example: A dog has states - color, name, breed as well as behaviors â€“ wagging the tail, barking, eating.
An object is an instance of a class.
Object is a physical entity.
Object is created through new keyword mainly e.g:-Student s1=new Student();
	Object is created many times as per requirement.

/*Class is a blueprint or template from which objects are created.
Class is a logical entity.
Class is declared using class keyword e.g.class Student{}
Class is declared once.*/
